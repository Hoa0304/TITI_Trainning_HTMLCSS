</details>



<details>
<summary>Target Audience</summary>

- You should understand the people who will use the website

- Knowing the makeup of your target audience — including age, gender general demographic background, and level of computer literacy — helps you design a website appropriate for them.


</details>



<details>
<summary>Multiplatform Display</summary>

__How do I consistently reach the people in my target audience when they are using so many difference devices?__

>  The solution is to use responsive design, which allows you to create one website that provides an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices. The website itself responds and adapts to the size of screen on the visitor’s device.

<summary>Accessibility Standards for Webpage Developers</summary>

- According to the W3C, the goal of the web is to be accessible to all people, including those with a disability that limits their ability to perform computer tasks. 
- Anyone who wants to use the web must have content that incorporates the principles as follows:

+ __Perceivable:__ Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Users must be able to perceive the information being presented. (It cannot be invisible to any of their senses.)Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable. Users must be able to operate the interface. (The interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.)


+ __Understandable:__ Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface. (The content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding.)

+ __Robust:__ Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistivetechnologies. Users must be able to access the content as technologies advance. (As technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible.)

<summary>Understanding the Role of Other Web Programming Languages</summary>

<details>
<summary>JavaScript</summary>

- _JavaScript_ is a popular scripting language used to create interactivity within a web browser. Common uses for JavaScript include creating popup windows and alert messages, displaying the current date, and validating form data. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that the browser processes it on the client computer. JavaScript fles are typically named script with an .js fle extension. 
> JavaScript fles are referenced within an HTML fle through the use of a script element, as in <script src="script.js"></script>.  Reference to this fle is typically placed above the closing body tag. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>jQuery</summary>

- _jQuery_ is a library of JavaScript programs designed for easy integration onto a webpage. jQuery makes it easy for web developers to add JavaScript to a webpage. The JS Foundation, formerly known as the jQuery Foundation, (https://js.foundation) is a community of web developers that work together to create JavaScript ecosystem projects. Their mission is to “drive broad adoption and ongoing development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies.”

<details>
<summary>PHP</summary>

- PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source scripting language often used for common tasks such as writing to or querying a database located on a central server. PHP is a  server-side scripting language, which means that the PHP script is processed at the server. The result of the PHP script is often an HTML webpage that is sent back to the client. Pages that contain PHP scripts must have fle names that end with the fle extension .php.

</details>

<details>
<summary>ASP</summary>

- ASP (Active Server Pages) is a server-side scripting technology from Microsoft used to accomplish many of the same server-side processing tasks as PHP. Pages that contain ASP scripts must have fle names that end with the fle extension .asp.

<summary>Creating a Basic Webpage</summary>

<img src="1-31.png">

- __Do I have to indent certain lines of HTML code?__
_Indenting lines of code is not required, but it helps improve the readability of the webpage. In Figure 1–31, Lines 4 and 5 are indented to clearly show the elements contained in the <head> and </head> tags. If the code included elements between the <body> and </body> tags, those lines could also be indented to make them easier to read. Using indents is a good web design practice._
